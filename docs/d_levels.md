# Dungeon Levels

As of `v0.3.3-alpha` the dungeon have 5 levels to complete.<br>
A the end of level is marked when a portal opens downwards<br>
(usually when the boss monster in the floor is killed)<br>
if everybody jumps down then the next level will start<br>

There are some items that can override the default working of the dungeon:<br>
- [Call of Abyss] Opens a portal anywhere in the current room
- [Call of Heaven] Teleports you and your teammates to the surface with your items intact

The levels are procedurally generated, there are instances when some rooms doesn't or does generate<br>
even the room's count are not fixed<br>

The level's names follow:

  <summary>Spoiler warning</summary>
  
  When you complete every level you will be able to continue go downwards (by jumping down in the portal)<br>
  or you can click on the floating star above the portal to teleported back to the surface<br>
  If you leave the dungeon you keep everything except Influences and Perks.<br>
  <br>
  If you instead jumped down then you will be teleported back to Level 1 (Tier 2)<br>

## Tiers

<details>
  <summary>Spoiler warning</summary>
  
  Tiers are part of the end-game. When you beat the final boss the game gives the option<br>
  to proceed downwards. If you do so then you will start at Level 1 and gain +1 Tier<br>
  Higher tier means monsters' have more health and deal more damage but you have better chances<br>
  at finding better loots.<br>
  
  Tiers are visually represented by an adjective before the mobs' name or when a new level title are sent<br>
  (For instance: Tier 2 would send you "Twisted Limbo" instead of "Limbo" for level 1)<br>
  There are 39 named tiers after reaching the 40th tier<br>
  the monsters wont be any stronger but you can keep playing infinitly<br>
