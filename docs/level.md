# Level

Every player starts at level 1 which can be seen<br>
on the right panel of the screen (on the scoreboard)<br>

Level has no hard limit (technically 2_147_483_647 is the max level)<br>
however every new level has higher experience requirement than the previous<br>

Every level up will grant a "Level Point" which you can spend on increasing your properties/stats<br>
These stats will remain even after death and will always start at that value<br>
The upgrades are limited which means you can reach a level where you gain points even after<br>
maxing out every stats<br>

## Upgrades

## Ways to level up faster

1. Focus on reaching deeper, stronger monsters give you better experience (even if you manage kill fewer of them)
2. Try to get experience bottles (called "Souls") from gambling in the trader's room
3. Try to find experience bottles, epic chests are the best way of obtaining them
4. Play with friends, the party's experience will be split between players (except bosses, they provide the same for everybody)
5. If you able to beat to the final boss then consider `Ascension` it provides huge boost to the experience gains
